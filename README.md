# Capstone GitHub Training Repo
## Build the Best Collaborative Story (Using GitHub Like a Real Team)

### Goals
- Protect "main": set a new branch ruleset (PM)
- Create PR (All)
- Resolve conflicts (All and PM)
- Contribute to updtream (PM)

### Steps
1. PM forks the upstream (CMC-DSCapstone/sp2026-github-training)
2. PM creates a new file (from GitHub) named, team-<TEAM_NAME>.md
3. PM sets a new branch ruleset -- protect "default" (1) require PR before merging and (2) require one review
4. PM invites the members to the origin (forked repo) as collaborators
5. Each member clones the origin to their local computer and update the team-<TEAM_NAME>.md file by adding their name and GitHub account name
6. Each member open PR to origin and add a reviewer
7. After having all team member names, PM open PR to upstream
8. The first team make the PR wins

### Issues might happen
- no git environment
- no git installation on the local computer
- no origin set up
- etc. etc.
